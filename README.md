## Introduction
Using the EchoNet Dynamic dataset, that contains a lot of images of different patient's echocardiograms, with Image Segmentation and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, we want to be able to predict the masks of the area of the left ventricle of every echocardiogram image. This can be helpful for medical experts to extract information and diagnose patients with greater ease.

## Scope
We want to determine the better model for this situation, between a Landmarks Model or a Masks Model. We choose the best model based on the accuracy of the masks generated by the model that is .
